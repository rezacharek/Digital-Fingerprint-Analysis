# Digital Fingerprint Analysis

## Authors
This project was completed by Maya Costantini, Matthias Lotta, Gr√©goire Lambert, Diana Farkhat and Roman Zacharek for our Master's coursework.

## Compiling

To compile test executables :

```
cd build
rm -rf *   # be careful with this
cmake ..
make
```

To compile documentation :
```
cd build
rm -rf * # be careful
cmake ../documentation
make
```

You can navigate through the documentation for instance using firefox :
```
firefox ../documentation/html/index.html
```

## Opencv install

You might want to install opencv on your computer for the project. As a warning,
even with the instructions it can take quite a while ! I'll just share some 
minimal installation instructions which worked for me but it might be "improvable".
I hope this will be enough for most of us, with no bug whatsoever

I mostly used this link and I'll copy paste the most relevant lines:
https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html

Open a terminal and install the first dependancies (Roman have fun with homebrew):
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
```

Chose someplace in your computer, then :
```
wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.2.0.zip 
unzip 4.2.0.zip
```

will download opencv and extract it.
Run this :
```
cd opencv-4.2.0
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
```

and :
```
make -j4 # runs 4 jobs in parallel
```
This might take quite a long time and burn your computer perhaps. If this is the
case, call the 18, then use : `-j2` instead, which should be better but longer.

Then :
```
sudo make install
```

It should be good enough. If no error has appeared until there, you may
download an [empreinte genitale](http://stateuic.habite.la/drawings/517.0.png) and compile this code :

```
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

using namespace cv;

int main(int argc, char** argv){
    Mat image = imread("empreinte_genitale.png");
    return 0;
}
```
with the command line :
```
g++ your_cpp_file.cpp -o app_temp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`

```
When executing, if there is no error you're good !

There is [this](https://www.opencv-srf.com/p/introduction.html) real nice website for real nice tutorials.
In particular [this part](https://www.opencv-srf.com/2017/11/load-and-display-image.html) is quite useful to load and display !


## USEFUL DEBUGGER

Useful debugger to locate leaks : valgrind and cgdb

Install :
```
sudo apt-get install valgrind 
sudo apt-get install cgdb
```

valgrind helps you locate where the leaks in your program are, and displays the errors in the file "debug.txt

```
valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file="debug.txt" ./starter_2
```
